Original code of a contract can be replaced by the SETCODE instruction.

The intended sequence of actions to demonstrate code replacement:
1. Deploy setcode.c contract.
2. Call setcode() method passing binary code of setcode_new.c as parameter.
3. Observe the value computed by run() method has changed.
