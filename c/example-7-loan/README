The bank contract keeps per-client information (available credit)
in the map_persistent dictionary.

A client calls the bank to get a credit.

Interaction sequence:
1. Setting up the bank:
  - call constructor,
  - call set_allowance method for each client address.
2. Running client contract(s):
  - call get_my_credit method passing the bank address,
  - expect a credit_persistent update after the bank calls back.
