# New sample contracts in Solidity:
    - contract01: demonstrates how to save data to a persistent storage. Use the ***getaccount*** command to obtain the contract state;
    - contract02: demonstrates how to call a remote contract by passing an integer. The remote contract saves this integer and it is available for checking;
    - contract03: demonstrates how to use the ***msg.sender*** function to get address of a contract that called you;
    - contract04: demonstrates how to transfer grams with the ***address.transfer()*** function;
    - contract05: callback implementation. One contract calls another one and gets response with a callback;
    - contract06: demonstrates implementation of mappings, external methods and callbacks as well.
